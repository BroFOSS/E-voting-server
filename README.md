# Motivation

In many institutions, we still use the manual based voting system, where a user is required to go to a place and write his/ her vote in a paper, and then submit in a box. After few weeks, the results are declared using manual counting. Our idea to create an open source, secure, e-voting system, which can be used by such different institutions to automate their processes.
